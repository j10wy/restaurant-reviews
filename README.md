# Mobile Web Specialist Certification Course

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.

**Stage One**, take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Also, add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### What do I do from here?

1. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.

2. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

## Mapbox API Key

My Mapbox API key is loaded in the HTML file. The token/key is referenced throughout the app with the
variable name `mapboxApiKey`.

**index.html**

```html
<script type="application/javascript" src="js/mapbox-key.js"></script>
```

**js/mapbox-key.js**

```js
const mapboxApiKey = "<MAPBOX API KEY HERE>";
```
